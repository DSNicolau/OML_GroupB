# OML_GroupB

Welcome to our Machine Learning project repository! This project is a culmination of our efforts in exploring supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques as part of our coursework at Polythecnic of Leiria for the subject Optimization and Machine Learning. 

## Project Structure

Our project adheres to a specific order as depicted below:

📁 OML_GroupB/  
├─📁 data/  
│ └─📄 Dataset_Group_B.xlsx  
├─📁 Python/  
│ ├─📁 classification/  
│ │ ├─📁 evaluation  
│ │ ├─📁 examples/  
│ │ │ ├─📄 optuna_studies.db  
│ │ │ ├─📁 data_analysis  
│ │ │ ├─📁 KNN/  
│ │ │ │ ├─📁 results  
│ │ │ │ ├─📄 knn_optuna.py  
│ │ │ │ └─📄 knn.py

│ └─📁 clustering  
└─📁 Orange  

The directories have the following information:

- **Orange:** Contains scripts for clustering and classification studies performed with the Orange framework.
- **Python/classification:** Scripts for classification studies developed in Python.

**Python/clustering:** Scripts for clustering studies developed in Python.

**data:** Dataset used for the project.

**evaluation:** Scripts with functions for plotting results and evaluating models.

**examples:** Contains directories with different explored models.

**models:** Contains some model classes created from scratch.

**Preprocessing:** Contains preprocessing functions developed for study and exploration.

**utils:** Additional scripts essential to the study.


## Note

Make sure to run the scripts from the project's home directory (inside OML_GroupB) to ensure access to all implemented functions and scripts.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different models and datasets. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
